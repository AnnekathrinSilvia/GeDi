#welcome;Welcome to the <b>Scoring</b> tour for <code>GeDi</code>.
#Step1;The tour will take you through the relevant elements of the UI. You can start the tour in each section by clicking on the dedicated button. You can (re)start the tour any time by clicking the dedicated button. The guided introduction can be exited any time by clicking outside of the highlighted area.
#sidebar; If you have not yet uploaded your data and dowloaded a Protein-Protein interaction (PPI) matrix, please use thise sidebar to navigate to the Data Upload panel and complete these steps.
#distance_calc_box; Once you have uploaded your data, you can calculate the distance between the individual genesets in your data. For this purpose, several different distance metrics are available.
#scoringmethod; Upon the distance metrics for the calculation is the Meet-Min distance which is based on th overlap coefficient. The overlap coefficient is a similarity measure which is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the minimum of the size of the two sets. To transform the similarity measure to a distance measure, the overlap coefficient is substracted from 1. The Meet-Min distance only takes the set composition into account.
#scoringmethod; The Kappa distance ist a set based distance which is based on the observed and expected agreement rates of two genesets. The definition of the Kappa distance can be found in the publication by Yoon et al.. In this application the Kappa distance is normalized to the (0, 1) interval to make it comparable to the remaining distance metrics.
#scoringmethod; The PMM score is an alternate version of the Meet-Min distance which has been adjusted to biological data. The original Meet-Min distance is weighted by the sum of the Protein-Protein interactions of the geneset members. The corresponding PPI matrix can be downloaded in the Data Upload panel. The exact definition of the PPI-weighted Meet-Min distance can be found in the by Yoon et al..
#scoringmethod; The Jaccard distance is based on the Jaccard coefficient which is defined as the size of the intersection of two sets divided by the size of the union of these two sets. The similarity is transformed to a distance metric by substracting the respective Jaccard coefficient from 1.
#score_data; After you selected a distance metric via the buttons on the left, you can start the calculation of the distance scores by clicking on the <b>Score the Genesets</b> button. This will start the calculation of the individual distance scores. However, please take into account that this action can take a long time depending on the number of genesets and the selected distance metric.
#tabcard_scores; After the calculation of the distance scores, the resulting scores will be visualized in this panel.
#tabsetpanel_scores; In the first panel, the distance scores will be visualized as a heatmap. Upon hovering over the heatmap, the involved genesets and calculated distance scores will be shown. You can also zoom into the heatmap by selecting an area of the heatmap. If you want to reset the view of the heatmap, you can simply click somewhere in the space outside of the heatmap to reset the view.
#tabsetpanel_scores; Besides the heatmap, the distance scores are also visualised as graph. In the graph, each geneset is a node and genesets with a distance score below a certain threshold a connected by an edge. The default threshold is set to 0.3, but you can adjust it via the slider on the left. The graph is also interactive. You can hover or click on nodes which will highlight the selected node and all connected nodes. You will also receive additional information about the respective geneset through the displayed text. Furthermore, you can follow the link to the Amigo database by clicking on the geneset id in the text field.
#Thanks;Thank you for taking the <b>Scoring</b> tour of <code>GeDi</code>!
