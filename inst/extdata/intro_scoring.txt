#welcome; Welcome to the <b>Scoring</b> tour for <code>GeDi</code>.
#Step1; This tour will take you through the relevant elements of the UI. You can start the tour in each section by clicking on the dedicated button. You can (re)start the tour any time by clicking the dedicated button. The guided introduction can be exited any time by clicking outside of the highlighted area.
#sidebar; If you have not yet input your data, please use the sidebar to navigate to the Data Input panel and complete these steps.
#distance_calc_box; Once you have input your data, you can calculate the distance between the individual genesets in your data. For this purpose, several different distance metrics are available.
#distance_calc_box; The protein-protein-interaction (PPI) weighted Meet-Min (<b>PMM</b>) score is an alternate version of the Meet-Min distance which has been adjusted to biological data. The original Meet-Min distance is weighted by the sum of the Protein-Protein interactions of the geneset members. The score is defined as <math display="block"><mi>PMM</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>min(PMM(A->B)</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>PMM(B->A))</mi></math>, where <math display="block"><mi>PMM(X->Y)</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>1</mi><mo>-</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>|X</mi><mo>&#8745</mo><mn>Y|</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>min(|X|</mn><mo>,</mo><mi>|Y|)</mi></mrow></mfrac><mi><mo>-</mo></mi><mfrac><mrow><mi>&#945</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>min(|X|</mn><mo>,</mo><mi>|Y|)</mi></mrow></mfrac><mrow><mi>&#8721 <sub>x&#8946X-Y</sub></mi><mfrac><mrow><mi>w &#8721 <sub>y&#8946X&#8745Y</sub>PPI(x, y)</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>&#8721 <sub>y&#8946Y-X</sub>PPI(x, y)</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>max(PPI)</mn><mo>*</mo><mi>(w*|X&#8745Y| + |Y - X|)</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>, and <math display="block"><mi>w</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>min(|X|, |Y|)</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>|X|</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>|Y|</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>. <mi>&#945</mi> is a scaling factor between 0 and 1. The corresponding PPI matrix can be downloaded in the <b>Data Input</b> panel. The exact definition of the PPI-weighted Meet-Min distance can be found in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-5738-6">paper</a> by Yoon et al..
#distance_calc_box; The <b>Kappa</b> distance ist a set based distance which is based on the observed and expected agreement rates of two genesets. It is defined as <math display="block"><mi>Kappa</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>1</mi><mo>-</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>E</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>E</mi></mrow></mfrac></math>, where <math display="block"><mi>O</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>|A&#8745B|</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>|(A&#8746B)<sup>c</sup>|</mn></mrow><mrow><mi>U</mi></mrow></mfrac></math> and <math display="block"><mi>E</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>|A|*|B|</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>|A<sup>c</sup>|*|B<sup>c</sup>|</mn></mrow><mrow><mi>U<sup>2</sup></mi></mrow></mfrac></math> and U is the set of all unique genes in the data. In this application the Kappa distance is additionally normalized to the (0, 1) interval to make it comparable to the remaining distance metrics.
#distance_calc_box; The <b>Jaccard</b> distance is based on the Jaccard coefficient which is defined <math display="block"><mi>Jaccard</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>1</mi><mo>-</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>|A</mi><mo>&#8745</mo><mn>B|</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>|A</mn><mo>&#8746</mo><mi>B|</mi></mrow></mfrac></math>. This is based on the Jaccard similarity which is substracted from 1 to trasnform the similarity to a distance metric. The distance is solely based on set comparison.
#distance_calc_box; Another available distance metric upon the choices in <code>GeDi</code> is a transformation of the overlap coefficient which is called the <b>Meet-Min</b> (MM) distance. The overlap coefficient is a similarity measure which is defined as <math display="block"><mi>OC</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>|A</mi><mo>&#8745</mo><mn>B|</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>min(|A|</mn><mo>,</mo><mi>|B|)</mi></mrow></mfrac></math>. In order to transform this measure of similiraty into a measure of distance, the overlap coefficient is substracted from 1, resulting in the calculation of the Meet-Min (MM) distance as <math display="block"><mi>MM</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>1</mi><mo>-</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>|A</mi><mo>&#8745</mo><mn>B|</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>min(|A|</mn><mo>,</mo><mi>|B|)</mi></mrow></mfrac></math>. As a solely set based measurement, the Meet-Min distance only takes the composition of the genesets into account but not the underlying biological information inherent in the genesets.
#score_data; After you selected a distance metric via the buttons on the left, you can start the calculation of the distance scores by clicking on the <b>Score the Genesets</b> button. This will start the calculation of the individual distance scores. However, please take into account that this action can take a considerable amount of time depending on the number of genesets and the selected distance metric.
#distance_scores_box; After the calculation of the distance scores, the resulting scores will be visualized in this panel.
#tabsetpanel_scores; In the first panel, the distance scores will be visualized as a heatmap. Upon hovering over the heatmap, the involved genesets and calculated distance scores will be shown. You can also zoom into the heatmap by selecting an area of the heatmap. If you want to reset the view of the heatmap, you can simply click somewhere in the space outside of the heatmap to reset the view.
#tabsetpanel_scores; Besides the heatmap, the distance scores are also visualised as graph. In the graph, each geneset is a node and genesets with a distance score below a certain threshold a connected by an edge. The default threshold is set to 0.3, but you can adjust it via the slider on the left. The graph is also interactive. You can hover or click on nodes which will highlight the selected node and all connected nodes. You will also receive additional information about the respective geneset through the displayed text. Furthermore, you can follow the link to the Amigo database by clicking on the geneset id in the text field. However, this of course only works if your data has GO ids as geneset ids.
#Thanks; Thank you for taking the <b>Scoring</b> tour of <code>GeDi</code>!
