[`GeDi`](https://github.com/AnnekathrinSilvia/GeDi) is a Bioconductor package containing a Shiny application designed for analyzing functional annotation analysis results. It offers an interactive interface to explore and gain insights into datasets, providing various graphs and tables to effectively mine the data. Its main focus is on GEneset DIstances (therefore the name GeDi), using distance measurements and clustering approaches to identify patterns and themes within enriched genesets. This reduction in data size simplifies interpretation and hypothesis generation for future analyses.

[`GeDi`](https://github.com/AnnekathrinSilvia/GeDi) is developed by Annekathrin Silvia Nedwed (https://github.com/AnnekathrinSilvia).
