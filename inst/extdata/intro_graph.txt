#welcome;Welcome to the <b>Graph</b> tour for <code>GeDi</code>.
#Step1;The tour will take you through the relevant elements of the UI. You can start the tour in each section by clicking on the dedicated button. You can (re)start the tour any time by clicking the dedicated button. The guided introduction can be exited any time by clicking outside of the highlighted area.
#sidebar; This panel requires that you first calculate distance scores on your genesets. If you have not done so yet, please use the sidebar to navigate to the <b>Score</b> panel and calculate distance scores.
#clustering_param_box; Once you have calculated distance scores for your input data, you can start clustering the genesets based on the distance scores. For the clustering, there are several thresholds available that influence the clustering result.
#clustering_param_box-label; The first parameter is the <b>Similarity Threshold</b>. This threshold determines which genesets are classified as similar by evaluating for which pair of genesets it holds <math display="block"><mi>distance_score(A, B)</mi><mo>&#8804</mo><mi>simThreshold</mi></math>. The default threshold for this parameter is set to 0.3.
#clustering_param_box; The second parameter is the <b>Membership Threshold</b>. This parameter indicates how many members of a proposed cluster need to have a close relationship (i.e. <math display="block"><mi>distance_score(A, B)</mi><mo>&#8804</mo><mi>simThreshold</mi></math>) to each other in order for the cluster to be formed. For example, if the Membership Threshold is set to 0.5 (50%) at least half of the members in a cluster need to have a close relationship to each other. If this is not the case the cluster will not be considered as such. The default value of this threshold is 0.5.
#clustering_param_box; The last parameter to set if the <b>Clustering Threshold</b>. This threshold determines how many members two clusters need to share in order for them to be merged into one larger cluster. Hence, this threshold can strongly influence the resulting number of clusters. The default threshold for this parameter is 0.5.
#cluster_data; Once you selected you thresholds, you can calculate the clusters of your data by clicking the <b>Cluster the Genesets</b> buttong. This operation can take some time depending on the number of genesets you have in your input data and your selected thresholds, so please have a look at the progress bar in the lower right corner which will inform you on the state of the clustering of your data.
#tabcard_cluster; Once the clusters of your data are determine, they will be visualized in this box.
#tabcard_cluster; In the <b>Geneset Graph</b> card, the individual clusters will be visualized as a graph. The nodes are individual genesets and edges are draw between genesets which belong to the same cluster. You can select and highlight individual nodes by using the <b>Select by id</b> functionality on the left or you can highlight all nodes of a cluster by selecting the respective cluster via the <b>Select by cluster</b> option. In this graph, only genesets belonging to at least one cluster will be shown, so please do not be suprised if you cannot find a specific geneset of your input data.
#controlbar-toogle; In order to provide additional information in the <b>Geneset Graph</b>, the option to color the nodes by specific parameters of your input data is provided. In order to select the parameter in use for the coloring, you can open up the controlbar via the gear icon in the upper right corner.
#graphColoring-label; In this drop-down menu, you will see all the available options from your input data which can be used to color the nodes. If you selected the appropriate parameter, you can close the controlbar again by clicking on the gear icon.
#graphcluster_Network; You can also interact with the shown network, by relocating individual nodes of the network. For this simply select one of the nodes, hold the left button of your mouse and drag the node to a place of your choice. With this you can change the placement of individual nodes and cluster. This is especially helpful in cluttered graphs and crowded areas of the network.
#tabcard_cluster; The <b>Cluster-Geneset Bipartite Graph</b> is a bipartite visualization of the clusters. Here, the nodes are clusters and genesets and edged are between clusters nodes and the genesets nodes which belong to the respective cluster. Upon hovering over the nodes, you will also get additional information about the data. For the cluster nodes, the members of the respective cluster will be listed, while for the geneset nodes the respective genes belonging to the genesets will be shown.
#card_clustering; The cluster information is also summarized in a table-like format in the <b>Clustering graph summaries</b> box. The tabel will show each geneset and the cluster the repective geneset belongs to. The table also has a search function, so you can easily look for a geneset of interest.
#Thanks;Thank you for taking the <b>Graph</b> tour of <code>GeDi</code>!
