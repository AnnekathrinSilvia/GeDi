#tab_data_upload; In this tab you will upload the data which will be used to calculate the geneset distances scores.
#ui_panel_data_upload; In the fist step you upload the data. You can upload the data as a plain text file. The data is xpected to have at least two columns; one column <b>Genesets</b> which specifies the names of the genesets and one column <b>Genes</b> which lists the genes in the individual genesets.
#Genesets_preview; Once you uploaded your data, you can have a look at it by expanding the collapsed <code>Geneset preview</code>.

The species of your data is needed to download the right <b>Protein-Protein-Interaction (PPI)</b> matrix, which will be used in subsequent steps.
#ui_panel_download_ppi; After succesful completion of the second step, a third box labeled <b>Step 3</br> will appear. In this step, you can download the corresponding PPI matrix.
#PPI_preview; After the PPI matrix has been downloaded, you can have a look at it via the collapsed <code>PPI preview</code> box.
#sidebar; Once you have successfully completed all three steps of the data upload, you can navigate to the next panel via the sidebar.
