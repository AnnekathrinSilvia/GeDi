#welcome;Welcome to the <b>Data Input</b> tour for <code>GeDi</code>.
#Step1;The tour will take you through the relevant elements of the UI. You can start the tour in each section by clicking on the dedicated button. You can (re)start the tour any time by clicking the dedicated button. The guided introduction can be exited any time by clicking outside of the highlighted area.
#tab_data_upload; In this tab you will provide the data which will be used to calculate the geneset distance scores.
#ui_panel_data_input; In the first step you provide your data. You can either provide your data as a <code>data.frame</code> in a RDS object, or as either a plain text file or in csv format. As stated in the <b>Welcome</b> panel, there are only minimal requirements at the format of the input. We expect your input to have two specific columns, one called <b>Genesets</b> which contains some form of identifiers for the individual genesets in your data and one called <b>Genes</b> which includes the genes that belong to the genesets of your input.
#btn_loaddemo; However, if you are not entirely sure how the input data should look like or you want to test out <code>GeDi</code> before generating your own data, you can click this button to load some demo data which can be used to explore the app.
#Genesets_preview; Once you provided input data, you can have a look at it by expanding the collapsed <code>Geneset preview</code>. To expand this element, just click the plus sign at the right corner of the box. Similarly, to collapse the expanded element again, you just have to click the sign again (upon expanding the plus will change to a minus sign).
#ui_filter_data; Upon successfully loading some input data, a box for an optional filtering step will appear. Users are adviced to use this box to identify large and generic genesets in their data which will most likely not improve the overall results of the analysis but will negatively influence the runtime of the whole process. The choice of a resonable filtering metric is left to the users. Possibilities for such metrics could be to filter the largest 10% of genesets or to filter genesets with more than 100 associated genes. However, we want to mention that the filtering is not a necessary step and can also be skipped. If you do not wish to filter genesets from your input data, you can simply collapse this box via the minus sign in the upper right corner.
#ui_panel_specify_species; After you sucessfully loaded and optionally filtered data, you can proceed with <b>Step 2</b>. In this step you can select the species of your data to download the respective <b>Protein-Protein-Interaction (PPI)</b> matrix. This PPI matrix is needed for the PMM score, one of the distance scores you select in the <b>Scores</b> panel. You can select the species of your data from a list of preselected species or you can type the name of your species in the box. If you are unsure about the spelling or if your organism of interest has an associated PPI matrix, you can use the link in the box to access the STRING website. This step is also optional, as you do not need the PPI for each of the available scores. You can also skip this step and come back later to download the PPI.
#ui_panel_download_ppi; Once you specified the species of your data, you can download the respective PPI matrix in <b>Step 3</b>. This operation will take some time, so look out for the progress information on your download in the lower right corner of the page.
#PPI_preview; After the PPI matrix has been downloaded, you can have a look at it via the collapsed <code>PPI preview</code> box. The PPI matrix is stored as a <code>data.frame</code> and contains three columns: <b>Gene1</b> and <b>Gene2</b> which contain the gene symbols of the corresponding interacting proteins and a column <b>combined_score</b> which reflects the confidence of the interaction. The score is based on the number of known interactions between two proteins normalized to the (0, 1) interval through <math display="block"><mi>combined_score</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>#interactions</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>min</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>max</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>min</mi></mrow></mfrac></math> where <b>min</b> and <b>max</b> are the number of fewest and most interactions respectively.
#sidebar; Once you have successfully completed all three steps of the data input, you can navigate to the next panel via the sidebar.
#Thanks;Thank you for taking the <b>Data Input</b> tour of <code>GeDi</code>!
