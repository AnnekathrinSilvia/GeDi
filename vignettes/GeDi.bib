abstract = {DAVID bioinformatics resources consists of an integrated biological knowledgebase and analytic tools aimed at systematically extracting biological meaning from large gene/protein lists. This protocol explains how to use DAVID, a high-throughput and integrated data-mining environment, to analyze gene lists derived from high-throughput genomic experiments. The procedure first requires uploading a gene list containing any number of common gene identifiers followed by analysis using one or more text and pathway-mining tools such as gene functional classification, functional annotation chart or clustering and functional annotation table. By following this protocol, investigators are able to gain an in-depth understanding of the biological themes in lists of genes that are enriched in genome-scale studies.},

@article{Alasoo2018,
abstract = {Regulatory variants are often context specific, modulating gene expression in a subset of possible cellular states. Although these genetic effects can play important roles in disease, the molecular mechanisms underlying context specificity are poorly understood. Here, we identified shared quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for chromatin accessibility and gene expression in human macrophages exposed to IFN$\gamma$, Salmonella and IFN$\gamma$ plus Salmonella. We observed that {\~{}}60{\%} of stimulus-specific expression QTLs with a detectable effect on chromatin altered the chromatin accessibility in naive cells, thus suggesting that they perturb enhancer priming. Such variants probably influence binding of cell-type-specific transcription factors, such as PU.1, which can then indirectly alter the binding of stimulus-specific transcription factors, such as NF-$\kappa$B or STAT2. Thus, although chromatin accessibility assays are powerful for fine-mapping causal regulatory variants, detecting their downstream effects on gene expression will be challenging, requiring profiling of large numbers of stimulated cellular states and time points.},

@article{Love2014,
abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html webcite.},

@article{Dutertre2019,
abstract = {Human mononuclear phagocytes comprise phenotypically and functionally overlapping subsets of dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes, but the extent of their heterogeneity and distinct markers for subset identification remains elusive. By integrating high-dimensional single-cell protein and RNA expression data, we identified distinct markers to delineate monocytes from conventional DC2 (cDC2s). Using CD88 and CD89 for monocytes and HLA-DQ and Fc$\epsilon$RI$\alpha$ for cDC2s allowed for their specific identification in blood and tissues. We also showed that cDC2s could be subdivided into phenotypically and functionally distinct subsets based on CD5, CD163, and CD14 expression, including a distinct subset of circulating inflammatory CD5âˆ’CD163+CD14+ cells related to previously defined DC3s. These inflammatory DC3s were expanded in systemic lupus erythematosus patients and correlated with disease activity. These findings further unravel the heterogeneity of DC subpopulations in health and disease and may pave the way for the identification of specific DC subset-targeting therapies. Using high-dimensional protein and RNA single-cell analyses, Dutertre et al. analyze human dendritic cell and monocyte subsets and identify markers that delineate them and unravel their heterogeneity. They also reveal the presence of inflammatory CD14+ DC3s, a subset of cDC2s, that correlate with disease progression and may be functionally involved in systemic lupus erythematosus immunopathology.},
